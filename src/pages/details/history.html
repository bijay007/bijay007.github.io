            <h2>Background Info</h2>
            <p>
                Formed in 1990 by Deepak Rana (now a Chopper pilot), Bhim Poon
                (now settled in Hong Kong), and Amrit Gurung, Nepathya has, in
                these last several decades, providing a platform to many
                musicians. It has seen 21 new faces come and go, but the name
                Nepathya and its popularity still consistently exist. Nepathya
                has been a platform for talented musicians. As music is yet to
                become a sustainable profession in Nepal, long-term commitments
                from musicians remain rare.

                Amrit Gurung has remained the guardian, leader, and currently
                the lead vocalist of Nepathya. With over 10 albums to its
                credit, Nepathya from its <cite>Chhekyo Chhekyo (छेक्यो
                    छेक्यो)</cite> days
                (released in the early 90s) to Jomsome Bazaarma (जोमसोमे बजारमा,
                released mid-90s) to <cite>Resham</cite>, (रेशम released 2001)
                to
                <cite>Bhedako Oon
                    Jasto</cite> (भेडाको ऊनजस्तो, released 2003) has maintained
                its
                consistency in the market. Nepathya's 7th album was called
                Ghatana …incidents of Nepal. Ghatana (घटना) was a musical
                expression of Nepal as Nepali people lived through the 2003-2005
                conflict struck Nepal.

                8th album Mero Desh (मेरो देश, released 2010) is a compilation
                of songs based on Nepathya's musical expression of current
                Nepal. Few songs are fresh and newly recorded, few are from it's
                back-catalogue which Nepathya still thinks is relevant and few
                have come in re-arranged and re-recorded forms.
                Nepathya's 9th album Aina Jhyal (ऐना झ्याल, released 2010), is a
                continuity of Nepthya's folk-rock genre. An outcome of Amrit's
                travel to the villages and the positive and peaceful direction
                the nation is heading after conflict and political transition.
                After the ninth album, Nepathya has released several singles
                with numbers like <cite>Shirphoola Siraima (शिरफूल शिरैमा),
                    Nanina
                    Taala (नैन ताल), Sainli Morilai (साइँली मोरीलाई)</cite>. Ten
                such
                singles have been compiled as the tenth album - Album X. The
                11th album commenced with the single Bhatbhate (भटभटे, released
                2022).
