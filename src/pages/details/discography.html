                    With this album, the band became a rock band. Since then it
                    changed its sound to folk-rock. The album was recorded with
                    live sessions where all musicians played their parts,
                    contrary to the previous productions when session players
                    assisted them. The title song Resham, Lampate Surati, and
                    Mai Nache remain inseparable parts of the setlist when the
                    band performs.
                    This album is credited for introducing, exploring, and
                    popularizing the folk-rock genre in the Nepali musical
                    scene.

                    The Album and the music within folk melodies from the Nepali
                    hills have been the 'lifeforce' of Nepathya's music.
                    Nepathya has always respected local essence and worked with
                    such complex issues in its own unique style. Their style of
                    collecting songs and melodies from across the Nepali
                    landscape has recently been documented in the award
                    documentary film- Bhedako Oon jasto ....in search of a song'
                    which has portrayed the search for this title song.

                    Nepathya is the Foremost folk-rock band of Nepal
                    consistently popular since 1990, which has well maintained
                    its social outreach through Lyrics and performance. Nepathya
                    has been mobilizing thousands of people through their songs
                    and touring concerts by initiating collective social action,
                    starting from the basic theme- peace and security in a
                    country facing the most challenging process of our times, a
                    peaceful political stability.
                    During insurgency, Nepathya was the only artistic group to
                    travel intensively across the nation advocating for peace
                    with their concert tours. The style of songs and the nature
                    of the tours initiated since 2001 till date are testimony to
                    Nepathya's goal for social change through music.
