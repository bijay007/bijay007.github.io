                Apart from folk,
                Nepathya's songs also portray contemporary Nepal - its pain
                at
                times of war and distress, and yet the ray of hope an artist
                sees and imagines of the future. Outside of Nepal, Nepathya
                has
                toured in the UK, the US, Australia, Japan, Israel, Germany,
                Finland, and India.
